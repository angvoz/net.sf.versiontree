== Documentation ==
=== Description ===
The Eclipse Version Tree Plugin is an extension for the Eclipse IDE that presents graphical history tree for files under CVS Source Control.

=== Short manual ===
Right-click on a file under CVS resource in the package explorer and select "Team -> Show in Version Tree" from the popup menu to display a version tree for a CVS resource.
<br/>Click on a revision in the version tree to display the details in the detail view on the right.
<br/>Double click a revision in the version tree to open an editor with the contents of that revision.
<br/>Open context menu on a revision to open or compare revisions.
<br/>Use context menu or plugin tool bar to choose layout.
<br/>Configure default layout, colors, sizes and icons: "Windows -> Preferences: Team / CVS / Version Tree".

CVS Version Tree will connect with arrows merged versions provided they are tagged accordingly. By default, CVS Version Tree recognizes the revision from which merge was done by tag "tag_branch-to_MERGE-FROM_branch-from" and the revision to which merge was done by tag "tag_branch-from_MERGE-TO_branch-to". Refer to the Preferences page to configure the tags.
